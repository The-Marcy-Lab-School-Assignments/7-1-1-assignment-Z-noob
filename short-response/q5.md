# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
Both `/products/apple` and `/products/5` match with the path because the path is similar `/products/:id`. Both have a dynamic id(:id), one is apple and the other is 5.  As for the paths that don't match, `/products` has no dynamic id, and `/products/5/about` has an extra `/about`.
