# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer
Single-Page Applications (SPAs) offer faster navigation and a smoother user experience by transitioning between views without full page reloads, creating a feel similar to a desktop app. They reduce server load by requesting only the necessary data and often provide better performance with client-side rendering. Additionally, SPAs use less bandwidth since they update only parts of the page and simplify development with a unified codebase. They also support rich interactions and complex features more easily. On the other hand, Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) excel in SEO because each page is a separate document, making it easier for search engines to index. They are well-suited for traditional sites with distinct pages and are simpler to build without complex client-side frameworks. MPAs offer a clear structure with separate pages, and each page load ensures the content is up-to-date.
