# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer
`"*"` path is used, when the URL doesnâ€™t match any of your predefined routes, the wildcard route can catch this and show a fallback component/page. You can also use it to handle dynamic routes where the exact path might vary, and you want to match any route that fits a certain pattern. Example of that is `<Route path="user/*" element={<UserProfile />} />`.
